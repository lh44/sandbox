## Design Patterns
* Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms
* Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability and
 maintainability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.
* Design patterns provide generic solutions, documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem.
* In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. 
Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.
