What to study?

Step 1 :

Learn few basic sorting algorithms along with their use case and time complexity.
* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Learn search algorithms along with time complexity.
* Linear Search
* Binary Search

Step 2 :
Stack
Queue
Single Linked List (Insert at front,back,middle; Delete at front back middle)
Double Linked List
Circular Linked List

Step 3 :
Learn the following approaches in algorithms
Divide and Conquer (Merger Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search are some examples)
Greedy method (Knapsack, Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, Dijkstra, Bellmanford)
Dynamic programming (0/1 Knapsack, Travelling Salesman Problem, Coin change)
Backtracking (N Queens problem)

Step 4 :
